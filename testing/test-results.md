## Setup Requirements

### 🔧 **DATABASE SETUP**

To run the tests successfully, you need to create test users in the database:

```javascript
// Create test users in MongoDB
db.users.insertMany([
  {
    username: "admin",
    password: "$2b$10$...", // bcrypt hash of "admin123"
    displayName: "Admin User",
    role: "admin",
    status: "active"
  },
  {
    username: "user1", 
    password: "$2b$10$...", // bcrypt hash of "user123"
    displayName: "Test User 1",
    role: "user",
    status: "active"
  },
  {
    username: "user2",
    password: "$2b$10$...", // bcrypt hash of "user123" 
    displayName: "Test User 2",
    role: "user",
    status: "active"
  }
]);
```

### 🚀 **RUNNING TESTS**

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd testing
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:projects
npm run test:milestones  
npm run test:attachments
```
